This repo is meant for a friend but I am leaving it open to the public if anyone would need such a thing. This code is meant for a chrome extension that will take and parse a CSV file and use matching to update a custom field in QuickBooks online payroll in his case. "tips collected" he gets this from a csv time sheet and needs to match to be able to update the payroll on his QB.
